HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms,
may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured
documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings,
paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags,
